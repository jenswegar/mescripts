# mescripts
A bunch of egoistic scripts and cli aliases for easier computer life.

The scripts found here are mainly targeted for use in my own MacOS environment and to make my own life easier, so unless I feel motivated I won't be putting too much effort into ensuring they are cross-platform. Having said that, if you do happen to find any of the stuff in here useful and want to contribute some fixes I'm happy to accept pull requests :) Also, if you find a bug but don't know how to fix it yourself, feel free to leave a bug report and I'll try to have a look at it.


## Setup

Most scripts assume the ZSH shell on MacOS and oh-my-zsh (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) installed.

### ZSH

Copy the content of the following files to the end of the ```.zshrc``` file:

* zsh/aliases
* zsh/named_directories
